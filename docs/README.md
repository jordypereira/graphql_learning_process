# New Technology: GraphQL

> For school I have to learn and document a new technology. Here's my story how I started to learn GraphQL.

_5 October 2018_

## Ben Awad

[Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/user/99baddawg) is a young developer and YouTube content creator.
His stack is React, React Native, GraphQL, Typescript, Node.js, PostgreSQL en Python. I've been watching his channel for a while now and discovered him on the reddit subreddit [/r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/).

## A featherjs + graphql Tutorial

Today I'll be starting one of his GraphQL tutorials, where I can code along with him. I'll be watching [GraphQL tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jw629xrkF8&list=PLN3n1USn4xlnd-eR3bEZvIr04yoiSRnUl), that consists of 35 videos. The first video was made in 3 January 2017.

You can read in detail how I went through the first [episode](./Ben_Awad/GraphQL_Tutorials/episode1.md)

Setting up the project didn't go as smooth as I had hoped. The Babel that he used was oudated and the commands weere completly different. So I just googled babeljs and started reading [the documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/usage). Eventually I got babel working by installing it locally in the project and using `npx babel-node` as the cli command.

For this project he will use [featherJS](https://docs.feathersjs.com/) and [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/). These have also changed quite a bit, so my setup just didn't want to work. So far my first project.

## GraphQL Typescript Server Boilerplate

I have learned a lot about Babel and read a bit about featherjs and apollo-server, but I have decided to choose an other project to start out with. [GraphQL Typescript Server Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eWIr6bbons&list=PLN3n1USn4xlky9uj6wOhfsPez7KZOqm2V) is the one I'll be trying. This one first released in 23 April 2018. Here we'll be exploring GraphQL, TypeScript and testing. I'm excited.

- In the [Project Setup](./Ben_Awad/GraphQL_Typescript_Server/episode0.md) we install the stack. We'll be using GraphQL Yoga, TypeOrm and Typescript. The installation is very easy and I already executed my first graphql query.

- [Creating an entity](./Ben_Awad/GraphQL_Typescript_Server/episode1.md) isn't very difficult, but I have trouble keeping up with TypeScript. Now I know I should be focussing on GraphQL, but maybe I'll watch a short introduction to TypeScript.
