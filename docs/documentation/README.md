# How I documented this

I first started documenting in Word. When I wanted to show some code in an image, it cut half my page and I couldn't get it right. So I gave up on word and started writing in markdown. Now I just need to display it. This is where [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) comes in play. Other options were GitBook and Hexo.

## Installation

I followed the installation guide at https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html#global-installation
which tells me I can easily add it with yarn.  
`yarn add -D vuepress`

## Create a navigation

https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/basic-config.html#config-file
I have to make a .vuepress directory in docs.
